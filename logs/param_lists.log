F_{p^d}

m | p^d - 1

p = 2 --> d is large because we need m | 2^d - 1 
p is large --> d is smaller --> more slots 


For example:
p = 31
m = 20000
phi(m) = 1000
d = 50

Number of slots: phi(m) / d = 20
In each slot: we can pack 30 elements of F_{30} into one element of F_{30^50} using RMFE. And still keep multiplication and addition correct.


Sender:   (x_1, x_2, x_3) --> one slot
Receiver: y_1

Comparison result: (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0) \in (F_{30})^30

x_1 --> price c_1
x_2 --> price c_2
x_3 --> price c_3

Map each of them back to F_{30^50}

(1, 0, 0) \in (F_{31})^30 -> c_1 \in F_{31^50}
(0, 1, 0) \in (F_{31})^30 -> c_2 \in F_{31^50}
(0, 0, 1) \in (F_{31})^30 -> c_3 \in F_{31^50}
